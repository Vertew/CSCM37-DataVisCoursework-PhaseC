# Pre-Requisites

-   Have Python installed if using an editor (using Google Colab
    prevents the need for this)

-   Have Pythons Altair installed (!pip install Altair) - version 4.2.2

-   Have Pythons Vega Datasets installed (!pip install vega_datasets)

(Both of these can be installed with one command: !pip install altair
vega_datasets)

-   Have Pandas installed (Altairs installation should come with Pandas
    by default)

# How To Run The Code

For the code to run, the data (.csv) files must be in the same directory as 
the python notebook file. They should already be in the correct location unless 
a web tool such as Colab is used, so simply launch the notebook from within 
the folder it is contained.

As it is, the notebook has already been run and the visualisation can be found
at the bottom. To rerun the code, simply run all cells in order.

# Suitable ways to run/open the notebook include but are not limited to:

-   Google Colab (web-editor) - Uses googles free computing power in the
    form of GPUs and TPUs
-   Jupyter Notebook (editor)
-   Visual Studio (editor)
-   IPython (editor)
