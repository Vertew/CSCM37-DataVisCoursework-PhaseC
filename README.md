# Pre-Requisits

-   Have Python installed if using an editor (using Google Colab
    prevents the need for this)

-   Have Pythons Altair installed (!pip install Altair) - version 4.2.2

-   Have Pythons Vega Datasets installed (!pip install vega_datasets)

(Both of these can be installed with one command: !pip install altair
vega_datasets)

-   Have Pandas installed (Altairs installation should come with Pandas
    by default)

# How To Run The Code

For the code to run, the data (.csv) files must be in the same directory as 
the python notebook file. They should already be in the correct location unless 
a web tool such as Colab is used, so simply launching the notebook from within 
the directory it is contained should work.

From there it's as simple as running the notebook file (PhaseCVisFinal.ipynb) 
in sequential order from start to finish, and the visualisation will be displayed 
at the bottom.

# Suitable ways to run/open the notebook include but are not limited to:

-   Google Colab (web-editor) - Uses googles free computing power in the
    form of GPUs and TPUs
-   Jupyter Notebook (editor)
-   Visual Studio (editor)
-   IPython (editor)
